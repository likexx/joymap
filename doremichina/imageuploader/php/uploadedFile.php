     Cases:
     
     1 - $tempFilename is empty

     1.1 - $dbFilename is empty
   
     There was no uploaded file, and no one has been uploaded. Nothing
     is performed.

     1.2 - $dbFilename is not empty

     There was a previously uploaded file, and it has been removed.
     The file must be deleted, and the database updated.
     
     2 - $tempFilename is not empty

     2.1 - $dbFilename is empty

     There was no uploaded file, and one has been uploaded.
     It must be assigned a descriptive name to the file, the file must
     be moved from the temporary directory to the uploads directory,
     and the database must be updated with the new name.

     2.2 - $dbFilename is not empty

     2.2.1 - $tempFilename == $dbFilename
   
     The uploaded file has not been changed. Nothing is performed.

     2.2.2 - $tempFilename != $dbFilename
   
     There was a previously uploaded file, and it has been replaced
     by a new one.
     The old uploaded file is deleted and a new unique, descriptive
     name must be assigned to the new uploaded file. The name stored
     in the database cannot be reused, because the extensions of the
     database's name and of the new file may differ, and the name
     with other extension may already exist.
     The new updated file is moved from the temporary directory to
     the uploads directory with the new filename.
     The database is updated if the new filename is different from
     the stored one.

     2.2.2.1 - SPECIAL CASE: $tempFilename is not in the temporary directory,
     but in the uploads directory

     This means that the current file was removed and the
     subsequent one has been put a position forward.
     For example, there are two files, in positions 1 and 2. The
     file in position 1 is removed and, as they are sortered,
     the file in position 2 is now placed in position 1.
     The file doesn't need to be moved to the uploads directory
     as it already is there.
     A new unique, descriptive name must be assigned to the new
     uploaded file, in order to not be deleted when the subsequent
     uploaded files are processed.
     The database is updated if the new filename is different
     from the stored one.
     *
     * @param string $tempFilename The temporary filename of a new uploaded file.
     * @param string $dbFilename   The filename of the old uploaded file.
     * @param string $keywords     The keywords to generate a descriptive filename.
     * @return string $newFilename The final filename of the new uploaded file,
